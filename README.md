### Abstract
Respiratory diseases, particularly pneumonia and COVID-19, continue to pose significant public health challenges worldwide. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective patient management and disease control. This project aims to develop and evaluate deep learning models for the automated classification of chest X-ray images into three categories: pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal cases. The publicly available "COVID-19+PNEUMONIA+NORMAL Chest X-Ray Image Dataset" from Kaggle will be utilized for training and testing the models (Kumar et al., 2022; Shastri et al.).
In addition to model development, we will create a user-friendly web interface that allows physician to upload chest X-ray images. This interface will enable easy access to our diagnostic tool, making it accessible to healthcare professionals and the general public. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), data augmentation, transfer learning, and attention mechanisms will be employed to enhance model performance and interpretability. The models will undergo rigorous evaluation using various performance metrics.
This project has the potential to contribute significantly to X-ray image analysis by providing a reliable and accessible tool for the early detection and differentiation of pneumonia and COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.
